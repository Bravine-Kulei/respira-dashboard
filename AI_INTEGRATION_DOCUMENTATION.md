## 🧠 **AI Algorithm Implementation**

### **Multi-Factor Analysis System:**

#### **1. Breathing Pattern Analysis (40% weight)**
```typescript
// Heart rate variability analysis
const variability = calculateVariability(heartRateData);
const trend = calculateTrend(heartRateData);

// Risk assessment
if (variability > 15 && trend > 10) {
  risk = 'high'; // Irregular breathing detected
  confidence = 87%;
}
```

#### **2. Environmental Risk Assessment (30% weight)**
```typescript
// Air quality correlation
if (airQuality < 60) {
  risk = 'high';
  triggers.push('Poor air quality detected');
}

// Rapid decline detection
const decline = previousAirQuality - currentAirQuality;
if (decline > 15) {
  risk = 'high';
  triggers.push('Rapid air quality decline');
}
```

#### **3. Temporal Pattern Recognition (20% weight)**
```typescript
// Time-based risk factors
if (hour >= 22 || hour <= 6) {
  risk = 'medium'; // Night-time increased risk
}

// Historical pattern analysis
const sameTimeData = historicalData.filter(similarTimeRange);
if (avgHeartRateAtThisTime > 90) {
  risk = 'high'; // Historical elevated readings
}
```

#### **4. Stress Indicator Detection (10% weight)**
```typescript
// Physiological stress markers
if (heartRate > 100) {
  risk = 'high';
  indicators.push('Elevated heart rate detected');
}

// Behavioral pattern changes
if (inhalerUsageIncrease >= 2) {
  risk = 'medium';
  indicators.push('Increased inhaler usage pattern');
}
```

### **Risk Score Calculation:**
```typescript
riskScore = (
  breathingRisk * 0.4 +
  environmentalRisk * 0.3 +
  temporalRisk * 0.2 +
  stressRisk * 0.1
) * 100;

// Risk Level Mapping:
// 0-34:   Low Risk
// 35-59:  Medium Risk  
// 60-79:  High Risk
// 80-100: Critical Risk
```
